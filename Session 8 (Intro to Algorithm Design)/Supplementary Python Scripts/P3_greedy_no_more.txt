3. No, greedy algorithm cannot be used to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem.
   Consider this counterexample from J.E. Walter (n.d.):
       Item       a    b    c    d    e
       Values     3    5    8    4    10
       Weights    2    4    5    3    9
   Maximum Weight: 20

   Value-to-Weight Ratios:
       1.5    1.25    1.6    1.33    1.11

   Incorrect (greedy algorithm): 20
       achieved by taking c, a, d, and b
   Correct: 26
       achieved by taking c, a, b, and e
   
   Unlike the fractional knapsack problem, dynamic programming (not greedy algorithm)
   must be employed to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem.
