# 2020 AMSLI Informatics Enrichment Program Send-off Training
This repository contains some materials that I wrote for the <b>send-off phase</b> of the <b>2020 AMSLI Informatics Enrichment Program (AIEP)</b> organized by the Asian MathSci League, Inc (AMSLI).

Qualified students are invited to attend this 10-Satudray program, with the goal of training Filipino students to represent the country in global and international informatics, computational thinking, and programming competitions. These contests include:

- Dr CT International Competition (Design Thinking with Robotics and Computational Thinking International Competition) <i>organized by the Singapore International Math Contests Centre</i>
- Bebras International Challenge on Informatics and Computational Thinking <i>organized by the Bebras Community</i>
- Global Math and Coding Competition <i>organized by the World Mind Innovation League</i>


## Contents
I was given the opportunity to author the materials for the last five sessions of the high school training group. The topics covered are as follows:

### Session 6
This session serves to introduce the notion of algorithmic efficiency and how it is expressed using the Big O notation. Some efficient algorithms (e.g., binary search and exponentiation by squaring) are presented to motivate the transition from naive solutions. Bitwise operators are also discussed.

### Session 7
This session serves to introduce some common data structures and abstract data types: stacks, queues, trees (including binary search trees), and graphs. Tree and graph traversal algorithms, as well as insertion and searching operations on binary search trees, are also discussed.

### Session 8
This session serves to introduce some useful algorithm design paradigms: divide and conquer, greedy algorithm, and dynamic programming. Representatives examples, such as mergesort, Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, and getting the longest common subsequence, are also discussed.

### Sessions 9 and 10
These sessions serve to expose the trainees to an assortment of programming challenges of varying difficulty. Some of the problems in these handouts are taken from the Association for Computing Machinery - International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC).

<b>Python</b> is the language taught in the training program. At the end of each handout, exercises are also provided to allow the trainees to have hands-on coding experience. Supplementary Python scripts can also be found in this repository.

## About AMSLI
Established in 2017, the Asian MathSci League, Inc. (AMSLI) is a nonstock, nonprofit organization of mathematics, science, and informatics mentors that aims to foster global competitiveness among Filipino students and teachers by organizing seminar-workshops and training programs and by sending contingents to international correspondences and competitions. Awardees are recognized by the Department of Science and Technology through its Science Education Institute (DOST-SEI).
